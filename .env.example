# Airtable — powers both the products list and contact form submissions
# Create a free account at airtable.com, then:
#   1. Create a base with two tables: "Products" and "Inquiries"
#   2. Get your Base ID from the Airtable API docs (starts with "app...")
#   3. Create a Personal Access Token at airtable.com/create/tokens
#      with scopes: data.records:read, data.records:write
#      and access to your base
#
# These are SERVER-SIDE only — never use VITE_ prefix here
